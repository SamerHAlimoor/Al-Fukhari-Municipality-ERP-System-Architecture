# Integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for Al-Fukhari Municipality
# 🏗 Technical Project Overview
This repository showcases the architecture and functional modules of the comprehensive ERP system I engineered for Al-Fukhari Municipality. The system was designed to digitize all municipal operations, linking multiple departments into one secure, centralized database. Due to the sensitive nature of municipal data and legal records, the source code is kept in a Private Repository.
# 🏛 Core Functional Modules
# 1. Finance & Treasury Department (المالية وأمين الصندوق)
Inventory Management:Real-time tracking of municipal warehouses and assets.
Revenue & Expenditure: Automated logging of daily deposits, expenses, and budget tracking.
Treasury Integration: Dedicated portal for the Treasurer to manage cash flows and official financial records.
# 2. Water & Utilities Department (قسم المياه)
Asset Management: Monitoring of water wells and reservoirs infrastructure.
Billing System: Digital management of water meters, consumption tracking, and automated billing for residents.
# 3. Engineering & Urban Planning (الهندسة والتخطيط)
Permit Workflow: Digitized the application and approval process for building permits.
Urban Mapping Data: Structured storage for land department records and planning documentation.
# 4. Public Service Portal (قلم الجمهور)
Citizen Request Tracking: A front-facing system for residents to submit applications, complaints, and service requests with real-time status updates.
# 5. HR & Employee Self-Service (شؤون الموظفين والإدارة)
Individual Employee Portals: Every employee has a private dashboard to manage their profiles and job tasks.
Digital Internal Communications: All official interactions between employees and the administration (requests, approvals, and reports) are processed through the system.
# 6. Legal Affairs Department (الشؤون القانونية)
Case Archiving: Digital database for municipal legal cases, contracts, and official legal correspondence.
# 7. IT & System Administration (قسم الحاسوب)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Managing permissions across different departments to ensure data security.
System Health Monitoring: Oversight of server performance and database integrity.
# 🛠 Tech Stack & Security
Backend: PHP (Laravel) - Chosen for its robust security features and MVC architecture.
Frontend: Vue.js / JavaScript - To ensure a responsive and fast user interface for municipal staff.
Database: MySQL - Optimized for complex relational queries across different departments.
Security Measures: 2FA authentication for sensitive departments, SQL Injection protection, and encrypted data backups.
# 💡 Impact
This system successfully transitioned Al-Fukhari Municipality from paper-based workflows to a 100% Digital Environment, significantly increasing administrative efficiency and transparency in public service delivery.

# Deployment & Implementation:

Live Status: The system has been fully deployed and is currently operational on the Municipality's Private Server.

Handover: The project was officially handed over to the municipal administration after successful testing and staff training.

Visual Proof: I have included a set of Screenshots in this repository (or available upon request) showing the dashboard and various department interfaces to demonstrate the system's functionality while ensuring sensitive data remains obscured.

🖼 System Interface Showcase
Below is a collection of screenshots from the live system. These images demonstrate the user interface (UI), the dashboard architecture, and various departmental modules. (Note: All sensitive and personal data has been obscured to maintain privacy).
